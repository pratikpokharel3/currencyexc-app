# CurrencyExc â€“ View Exchange Rate Today

A simple and efficient web app that shows exchange rates of different currencies. The app also allows users to convert between currencies using exchange rate data from a public API. It's designed for quick conversions with a clean and responsive user interface.

The backend service integrates with the [Free Currency Exchange Rates API](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api) to provide fast and reliable exchange rate data.
